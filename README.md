# Bell State Demo (Cirq)

This is my first quantum program using Cirq.  
It creates and measures a Bell State using local simulation.

### What it does
- Creates 2 qubits
- Applies Hadamard + CNOT (entanglement)
- Measures the qubits 200 times
- Saves a histogram plot showing correlated outcomes

### Files
- `bell_state.py` — main program
- `bell_histogram.png` — output histogram

### How to run
